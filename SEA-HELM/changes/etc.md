# Other Relevant Information

## Dependencies

The `SEA-HELM` project relies on a set of Python dependencies, which are typically listed in `requirements.txt` and `backup-requirements.txt`. These dependencies cover various aspects of language model evaluation, including:

*   **Machine Learning Frameworks:** Libraries for model loading, inference, and data processing (e.g., `transformers`, `torch`).
*   **Evaluation Metrics:** Tools for calculating performance metrics (e.g., `bert-score`, `sacrebleu`, and the integrated `rouge_score`).
*   **API Clients:** Libraries for interacting with language model APIs (e.g., `openai`, `litellm`).
*   **Data Handling:** Libraries for data manipulation and I/O.

Users should ensure these dependencies are installed, preferably within a virtual environment (`.venv/`), to run the `SEA-HELM` evaluations successfully.

## Future Plans

Based on the current structure and recent activities, potential future plans for this integrated `SEA-HELM` codebase could include:

*   **Expansion of Evaluation Tasks:** Adding more diverse and challenging tasks to `seahelm_tasks/` to cover a broader range of language model capabilities and potential biases.
*   **Support for New Models and APIs:** Integrating support for additional language models and serving platforms within the `serving/` directory to expand the benchmarking scope.
*   **Automated Experimentation Workflows:** Developing more sophisticated scripts or CI/CD pipelines to automate the execution of experiments and the generation of reports.
*   **Enhanced Data Analysis and Visualization:** Improving the tools for analyzing `_seahelm_results_.json` files and visualizing evaluation outcomes for better insights.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Optimizing the evaluation pipeline for speed and resource efficiency, especially for large-scale experiments.
*   **Documentation and Examples:** Further enhancing the documentation (e.g., in `docs/`) and providing more detailed examples for setting up and running evaluations.

These areas represent opportunities for continued development and refinement of the language model benchmarking capabilities within this repository.
