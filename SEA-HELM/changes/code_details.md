# In-depth Analysis of Code-Level Changes

The primary code-level change in the last two days is the comprehensive integration of the `SEA-HELM` project into this repository, as reflected in commit `3cb04c224bb8d49ebd47fd46efa09a01f84176e4`. This commit effectively introduces the entire `SEA-HELM` codebase, which is structured to facilitate the evaluation of large language models.

## Overview of the Integrated `SEA-HELM` Codebase

The `SEA-HELM` directory contains several key components:

*   **`seahelm_evaluation.py`**: This is likely the main script for running evaluations, orchestrating the process of loading models, executing tasks, and calculating metrics.

*   **`seahelm_tasks/`**: This directory is crucial as it defines various evaluation tasks. Each subdirectory within `seahelm_tasks/` (e.g., `cultural/`, `instruction_following/`, `lindsea/`, `multi_turn/`, `nlg/`, `nlr/`, `nlu/`, `safety/`) represents a specific category of tasks, each containing its own configuration (`config.yaml`), Python scripts for task logic, and data files (`data/`). This modular structure allows for easy expansion with new evaluation tasks.

*   **`serving/`**: This directory contains implementations for serving different types of language models. Files like `litellm_serving.py`, `openai_serving.py`, and `vllm_serving.py` suggest support for various model APIs and local serving solutions, abstracting the model interaction layer.

*   **`rouge_score/`**: This appears to be a self-contained module for calculating ROUGE scores, a common metric for evaluating text summarization and generation tasks. Its presence indicates that ROUGE calculation is an integral part of the evaluation pipeline.

*   **`chat_templates/`**: This directory likely holds Jinja templates (`.jinja` files) for formatting prompts and model inputs, ensuring consistent interaction with different language models based on their specific instruction formats (e.g., `base_model.jinja`, `llama_template_wo_sys_prompt.jinja`).

*   **Utility Files**: Files such as `utils.py`, `constants.py`, and `base_logger.py` provide common functionalities, configurations, and logging mechanisms used across the `SEA-HELM` framework.

*   **`run` and `run_vertex`**: These are likely executable scripts for initiating evaluations, possibly differentiating between local runs and runs on platforms like Google Cloud Vertex AI.

*   **`output_test_option1/` and `output_vertex_ai_gemini_2_5_pro/`**: These directories are used to store the results and configurations of executed evaluation runs, providing a structured way to manage experiment outputs.

In summary, the integrated codebase provides a robust and extensible framework for benchmarking language models across a diverse set of tasks and serving environments.
