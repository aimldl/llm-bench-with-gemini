*   **Subject:** Integrate SEA-HELM contents into main repository

**Description:**
This commit marks a significant milestone by integrating the entire `SEA-HELM` project as a subdirectory into the main `benchmarking-sea-helm-with-gemini` repository. Previously, `SEA-HELM` was likely a separate Git repository. By removing its internal `.git` directory, its contents are now directly tracked by the parent repository. This change enables unified version control and easier management of the `SEA-HELM` codebase alongside the benchmarking project.

The integration includes all components of the `SEA-HELM` framework, such as:
*   Core evaluation scripts (`seahelm_evaluation.py`)
*   Task definitions and data (`seahelm_tasks/`)
*   Model serving implementations (`serving/`)
*   Utility functions (`utils.py`, `constants.py`, `base_logger.py`)
*   Chat templates (`chat_templates/`)
*   Documentation (`docs/`)
*   Experiment output directories (`output_test_option1/`, `output_vertex_ai_gemini_2_5_pro/`)
*   Dependencies (`requirements.txt`)

This commit provides the foundational codebase for conducting language model evaluations within this repository.
