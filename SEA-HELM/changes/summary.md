# Summary of Recent Changes and Experiments (Last Two Days)

## Codebase Changes

The primary codebase change in the last two days is the integration of the entire `SEA-HELM` project into the main repository. This was captured in commit `3cb04c224bb8d49ebd47fd46efa09a01f84176e4` on `2025-08-21`. This integration brings in a comprehensive framework for evaluating large language models, including various tasks, serving mechanisms, and utility functions.

## Executed Experiments

Several experiments were conducted using the `SEA-HELM` framework, generating run configurations and results. These experiments primarily involved two models: `Llama-3-2-3B-Instruct` and `gemini-2.5-pro`.

### Llama-3-2-3B-Instruct Experiments (August 20, 2025)
*   **Run Configurations:** Two run configurations were generated, indicating separate evaluation runs for the `Llama-3-2-3B-Instruct` model.
    *   `Llama-3-2-3B-Instruct_run_config_2025-08-20T15:29:25.553232.yaml`
    *   `Llama-3-2-3B-Instruct_run_config_2025-08-20T15:45:48.461390.yaml`
*   **Results:** One set of evaluation results was produced.
    *   `Llama-3-2-3B-Instruct_seahelm_results_2025-08-20T15:45:48.461390.json`
*   A `logfile.log` was also generated, likely containing detailed logs of the experiment.

### Gemini-2.5-pro Experiments (August 20-21, 2025)
*   **Run Configurations:** Multiple run configurations were generated, indicating several evaluation runs for the `gemini-2.5-pro` model across both days.
    *   `gemini-2.5-pro_run_config_2025-08-20T15:53:34.067068.yaml`
    *   `gemini-2.5-pro_run_config_2025-08-20T15:55:31.544426.yaml`
    *   `gemini-2.5-pro_run_config_2025-08-21T00:38:19.655551.yaml`
    *   `gemini-2.5-pro_run_config_2025-08-21T01:09:25.233256.yaml`
    *   `gemini-2.5-pro_run_config_2025-08-21T02:56:44.348133.yaml`
    *   `gemini-2.5-pro_run_config_2025-08-21T05:32:12.515441.yaml`
*   **Results:** Corresponding evaluation results were produced for these runs.
    *   `gemini-2.5-pro_seahelm_results_2025-08-20T15:55:31.544426.json`
    *   `gemini-2.5-pro_seahelm_results_2025-08-21T00:38:19.655551.json`
    *   `gemini-2.5-pro_seahelm_results_2025-08-21T01:09:25.233256.json`
    *   `gemini-2.5-pro_seahelm_results_2025-08-21T02:56:44.348133.json`
    *   `gemini-2.5-pro_seahelm_results_2025-08-21T05:32:12.515441.json`
*   A `logfile.log` was also generated, likely containing detailed logs of the experiment.

These experiments demonstrate active evaluation of both local (Llama) and cloud-based (Gemini) language models using the newly integrated `SEA-HELM` framework.
